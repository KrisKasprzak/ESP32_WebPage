  this example will show
  1. how to use and ESP 32 for reading pins
  2. building a web page for a client (web browser, smartphone, smartTV) to connect to
  3. sending data from the ESP to the client to update JUST changed data
  4. sending data from the web page (like a slider or button press) to the ESP to tell the ESP to do something

  If you are not familiar with HTML, CSS page styling, and javascript, be patient, these code platforms are
  not intuitive and syntax is very inconsitent between platforms

  I know of 4 ways to update a web page
  1. send the whole page--very slow updates, causes ugly page redraws and is what you see in most examples
  2. send XML data to the web page that will update just the changed data--fast updates but older method
  3. JSON strings which are similar to XML but newer method
  4. web sockets very very fast updates, but not sure all the library support is available for ESP's

  I use XML here...

  compile options
  1. esp32 dev module
  2. upload speed 921600
  3. cpu speed 240 mhz
  flash speed 80 mhz
  flash mode qio
  flash size 4mb
  partition scheme default


  NOTE if your ESP fails to program press the BOOT button during programm when the IDE is "looking for the ESP"
